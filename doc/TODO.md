TODO
====

* Add more development items on the agenda to the TODO file :)

* Reimplement the `ezpKernelWeb` kernel class override, kernel hack code block added to support this solution into a separate class which would reduce the kernel hack to one line and increase maintainability.

* This solution is designed (but not tested / refined) to work on -any- siteaccess properly configured, not just the administration siteaccess.
    * The solution and supporting documentation could be refined further to better support non-admin siteaccess usage.
    * If you wish to use this feature on a non-admin siteaccess let us know about your interest and we can discuss your use case requirements and we can refactor the solution to better provide for your own needs.

* Extend this solution and settings to support changing the default content object language and content object translation language list display order to support changing the content object display of existing content object translations to be displayed after switching languages.
    * If you wish for us to implement and support this feature let us know about your interest and once we know there is an interest we can refactor the solution to provide this feature.
